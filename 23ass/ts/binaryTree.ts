/*
In this example, we have two classes: TreeNode and BinaryTree. The TreeNode class represents a single node in the binary tree, storing a value and references to the left and right child nodes. The BinaryTree class is responsible for managing the tree structure, including insertion and other operations.

The insert method in the BinaryTree class follows a level order (breadth-first) traversal approach using a queue. It starts by checking if the root node exists; if not, the new node becomes the root. If the root node exists, it iteratively traverses the tree level by level using the queue until it finds the first available spot to insert the new node. The queue helps maintain the order of nodes to be processed.

You can extend this implementation by adding additional methods like search, delete, and various tree traversal algorithms such as pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals. These methods allow you to perform operations and retrieve data from the binary tree.

Remember that this is a basic implementation of a binary tree in TypeScript. Depending on your use case, you may need to modify or add more functionalities to meet your specific requirements.
