Building a Simple Class:

Task: Create a Car class with properties like make, model, year, and methods for start(), stop(), and display_info().
Objective: This assignment helps students understand how to define a class, its properties (attributes), and methods (functions).
Implementing Inheritance:

Task: Design a base class Shape with a method to calculate the area. Then, derive two classes from it: Circle and Rectangle. Each derived class should override the area calculation method.
Objective: This exercise focuses on inheritance. Students will learn how child classes can inherit from a parent class and how they can have their unique implementations.
Encapsulation and Data Hiding:

Task: Create a class BankAccount with private attributes like accountNumber and balance. Implement public methods to deposit(), withdraw(), and checkBalance() while ensuring that direct access to the attributes is not possible.
Objective: The goal here is to teach students about encapsulation and data hiding. They will learn how to control access to the class's data and how to provide a public interface for interaction.
